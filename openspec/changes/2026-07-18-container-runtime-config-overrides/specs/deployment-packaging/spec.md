## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Docker image MUST support single-node all-in-one delivery

DocLens-j MUST provide a Dockerfile for a single-node image that contains the
frontend assets, backend runtime, and PostgreSQL runtime support.

#### Scenario: Operator overrides common runtime values

- **WHEN** an operator runs the all-in-one image with runtime environment
  variables
- **THEN** they can override the application port and PostgreSQL port without
  rebuilding the image
- **AND** packaged default values still exist when those environment variables
  are omitted

#### Scenario: Operator mounts external runtime config

- **WHEN** an operator mounts an external Spring configuration directory into
  the all-in-one image
- **THEN** the runtime can read that directory through a default
  `SPRING_CONFIG_ADDITIONAL_LOCATION` hook
- **AND** packaged baseline config remains available alongside the mounted
  overrides

### Requirement: Helm chart MUST support Kubernetes deployment

DocLens-j MUST provide a Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment.

#### Scenario: Operator customizes application runtime surface

- **WHEN** an operator sets a custom application port or mounts extra config
  volumes through chart values
- **THEN** the rendered Deployment uses the configured container port
- **AND** the rendered Service routes to the same application port
- **AND** the rendered Deployment includes the requested extra volume and
  volumeMount entries for external runtime config
