## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Docker image MUST support single-node all-in-one delivery

DocLens-j MUST provide a Dockerfile for a single-node image that contains the
frontend assets, backend runtime, and PostgreSQL runtime support.

#### Scenario: Maintainer builds the all-in-one image

- **WHEN** a maintainer builds the Dockerfile from the repository root
- **THEN** the frontend dashboard assets are included in the backend runtime
- **AND** the server distribution is included in the final image
- **AND** PostgreSQL can be started inside the image for single-node use
- **AND** the Dockerfile uses local Docker images where possible
- **AND** the final runtime stage uses an Ubuntu base image
- **AND** the final runtime stage installs JDK21, Node22, and PostgreSQL from
  local build-context artifacts rather than downloading them during Docker
  build
